We're Night Lunch and we hope you're hungry. We're night lunch and I hope you brought your school ids. We're night lunch and the cafeteria is now open. We're night lunch and we hope you brought petty cash. We're night lunch like regular lunch but we happen at night. We're night lunch fighter of the day lunch. We're night lunch we came to kick ass and eat sandwiches and we're all out of sandwiches. We're night lunch and we hope you like papusas. We're night lunch and we're officially out of burgers. We're night lunch and we are officially out of tater tots. Tater tots for all. We're night lunch and there will be no leftovers. Night Lunch party of 4. Your table is ready.
